== README

Things I still need to do:

update CSS for project show pages

update CSS in general

set project/index to root

create categories, and resort projects

fix homepage link so it stops doing the underline thing.

add account verification so I'm the only one who can change things



Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
